# Medal-predictor-in-Olympics

### *This machine learning model predicts how many medals we think a country should have earned in a given olympics. The predictions are different from actual medal count.*

## PROCESS:

### 1. Form a Hypothesis: We can predict how many medals a country will win in the olympics.
### 2. Find the data : from dataset
### 3. Reshape the Data : We predict medal columns using Athelets and Prev Medals columns
### 4. Clean the data : Remove missing values
### 5. Error Metric: To figure out if the predictions are good or not. Error metric used here is *MEAN ABSOLUTE ERROR*

### 6. Split the data : Train and Test on different parts of the data.
### 7. Train model: We are using *LINEAR REGRESSION* here.
